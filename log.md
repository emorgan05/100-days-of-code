# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Project 1: Kim's website. Spent 45 min on hold with customer service. I think the domain name is properly migrated. We'll see in 24 hours. 
Project 2: Oreo Flavor Finder. Pencil mockup of what parts I want. Writing the HTML to create the page view to match. I think learning the CSS grid system will be a helpful approach. 
Realizing that I need to learn a lot more about user inputs and accessing that data.

**Thoughts:** Frustrated with customer service. 
Slightly overwhelmed with all I need to learn. 
Need to slow down and figure out the individual parts.

### Day 2: June 6 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website: Still not linked to the host. Checking back tomorrow. 
AngularJS App: Part 1: Wrote the HTML to have user input and got it formatted properly. 
Part 2: I need more learning. Started CodeSchool's AngularJS tutorial. Taking notes. 

**Thoughts:** I like learning.

### Day 3: June 7

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website. Still not linked to the host. Have to wait full 48 hours to call customer service again. 
AngularJS: Worked through level 1 and level 2 of CodeSchool's tutorial. Refreshed on Javascript if statements.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure this tutorial is taking me where I want to go with it.  

**Link to work:** http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs/level/2/wrap-up

### Day 4: June 8 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website. Changed hosts. eHost doesn't migrate like I want it to. Hopefully the new service will. Waiting to see. 
AngularJS. Finished CodeSchool tutorials. Much clearer on the different files. 

**Thoughts:** Didn't fully get to what I want with the tutorial. I still need to figure out how to push data to a server that can then be called back to all users. 
Hardest part was using the computer with my eyes dilated. I've got the blinds closed and my sunglasses on. 8 hours later. 

**Link to work:** https://www.codeschool.com/account/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs

**Total time:** 1 hour 50 min. 

### Day 5: June 9 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website is ALIVE!!!

**Thoughts:** Ok, that's not really coding, but what's the point of coding if it doesn't go live at some point. amIright? 

**Link to work:** www.kimmorgancummings.com

**Total time:** 2 hours

### Day 6: June 10 

**Today's Progress**: Did some things for Kim's website. Linking the MailChimp properly, pictures, payment stuff. Ran my Angular app in Plunker to see if I can get it to work. The answer: No. Started Ruby authentication to finish the Full Stack path. Course seems to be broken. Can't deal with customer service right now. 

**Thoughts:** Feels like no progress.

**Link to work:** www.kimmorgancummings.com

**Total time:** 2 hours

### Day 7: June 11 

**Today's Progress**: 1. Updated my personal website with Kim's new website URL and stuff. 2. Talked to customer support about the Rails authentication lesson. 3. Got to step 9 on the Rails Authentication. 4. Started FreeCodeCamp's Tribute page project.

**Thoughts:** I've gotten pretty ADD about what I am working on. I need a clear project that I feel like I can finish. 
I'm frustrated with Codecademy's lesson. I want to just finish the full stack path, but that lesson is so buggy, I'm not really learning anything. 

**Link to work:** https://codepen.io/emorgan05/pen/OgNzbz

**Total time:** 2 hr 20 min

### Day 8: June 12 

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Tribute page project. Backed up to their Bootstrap lessons to make sure I was using classes that would do the CSS for me. 

**Thoughts:** Backing up to look at Bootstrap classes was totally worth it. I didn't think I needed it, and some of their classes are out-of-date, but it pointed out a few things I can do, and then led me to look at a Bootstrap 4 cheat sheet, for the new classes that I could apply.

**Total time:** 2 hours

### Day 73: August 25 (Fri) 

**Today's Progress**: Tic Tac Toe

**Thoughts:** Got the logic in place. Added the computer moves. It's a dumb version -- the computer just takes the next available space.

**Total time:** 2 hours

### Day 77: August 30 (Wed)

### Day 79: Sept 1 (Fri) 

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School

**Thoughts:** Day 79 of 100 days of code is also day 1 of my bootcamp. This will give me a strong foundation not only in Ruby and Javascript, but also the other things I know to be a full-stack developer. It will solve that problem that I mentioned on the first day or two that I know there's so much I don't know, but I don't know how to learn it. I am doing the bootcamp full time, so suddenly my 2-3 hours are shifting into 8 ish. I'm excited.
