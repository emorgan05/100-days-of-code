# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Project 1: Kim's website. Spent 45 min on hold with customer service. I think the domain name is properly migrated. We'll see in 24 hours. 
Project 2: Oreo Flavor Finder. Pencil mockup of what parts I want. Writing the HTML to create the page view to match. I think learning the CSS grid system will be a helpful approach. 
Realizing that I need to learn a lot more about user inputs and accessing that data.

**Thoughts:** Frustrated with customer service. 
Slightly overwhelmed with all I need to learn. 
Need to slow down and figure out the individual parts.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
