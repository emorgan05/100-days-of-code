# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Project 1: Kim's website. Spent 45 min on hold with customer service. I think the domain name is properly migrated. We'll see in 24 hours. 
Project 2: Oreo Flavor Finder. Pencil mockup of what parts I want. Writing the HTML to create the page view to match. I think learning the CSS grid system will be a helpful approach. 
Realizing that I need to learn a lot more about user inputs and accessing that data.

**Thoughts:** Frustrated with customer service. 
Slightly overwhelmed with all I need to learn. 
Need to slow down and figure out the individual parts.

### Day 2: June 6 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website: Still not linked to the host. Checking back tomorrow. 
AngularJS App: Part 1: Wrote the HTML to have user input and got it formatted properly. 
Part 2: I need more learning. Started CodeSchool's AngularJS tutorial. Taking notes. 

**Thoughts:** I like learning.

### Day 3: June 7

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website. Still not linked to the host. Have to wait full 48 hours to call customer service again. 
AngularJS: Worked through level 1 and level 2 of CodeSchool's tutorial. Refreshed on Javascript if statements.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure this tutorial is taking me where I want to go with it.

### Day 4: June 8 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website. Changed hosts. eHost doesn't migrate like I want it to. Hopefully the new service will. Waiting to see. 
AngularJS. Finished CodeSchool tutorials. Much clearer on the different files. 

**Thoughts:** Didn't fully get to what I want with the tutorial. I still need to figure out how to push data to a server that can then be called back to all users. 
Hardest part was using the computer with my eyes dilated. I've got the blinds closed and my sunglasses on. 8 hours later.

**Total time:** 1 hour 50 min. 

### Day 5: June 9 

**Today's Progress**: Kim's website is ALIVE!!!

**Thoughts:** Ok, that's not really coding, but what's the point of coding if it doesn't go live at some point. amIright?

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
